# File: string_match.asm
# Description: A program that finds the number of entries in an array which 
#		contains a 4-bit string. For example, if the string is 0101, then 
#		11010110  would count. The array starts at position 32 and is 64 bytes 
#		long. The string you search for will be in the lower 4 bits of memory 
#		address 6. The result should be written to location 7.
#		Refer to string_match.cpp for equivalent C code
